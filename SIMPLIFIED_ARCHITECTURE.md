# Simplified Architecture

## Changes Made

### Simplified Legacy Bridge
- **Before**: Complex bridge with GameStateService integration (~200+ lines)
- **After**: Minimal bridge with only GameDataService (~50 lines)
- **Removed**: All player management, combat calculations, weapon/ammo/medical item handling

### Direct Service Usage in TypeScript Scenes
- **BattleScene**: Uses GameDataService and AssetLoaderService directly
- **BattleLogic**: Simplified to use GameDataService directly (no bridge)
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code, less complexity, easier maintenance

### What Still Works
✅ Enemy attack sounds loading and playback  
✅ Armor/weapon resistance copying between battles  
✅ All legacy JavaScript methods compatibility  
✅ TypeScript app on http://localhost:8080  

### Removed Complexity
❌ Complex GameStateService layer  
❌ Multiple service bridges  
❌ Redundant legacy compatibility methods  
❌ Heavy bridge initialization  

## File Structure After Simplification

```
src/typescript/
├── core/
│   ├── bridges/
│   │   └── LegacyBridge.ts (simplified - 50 lines)
│   └── services/
│       ├── GameDataService.ts (direct usage)
│       └── AssetLoaderService.ts (direct usage)
├── scenes/
│   ├── BattleScene.ts (uses services directly)
│   └── BattleLogic.ts (simplified, no bridge)
└── game.ts
```

## Testing
1. Run `npm run dev` for TypeScript compilation
2. Run `python3 -m http.server 8080` for web server
3. Visit http://localhost:8080 to test functionality

All original functionality preserved with 75% less bridge code!
