All core game scenes have been modernized with TypeScript, maintaining full gameplay functionality while adding type safety, better architecture, and comprehensive service integration.

### 🎯 **Completed Scenes**

  - Interactive popup system with custom actions
  - Road video background with fallback graphics
  - Dynamic soundtrack rotation
  - Player status display (level, health, controls)
  - Scene transitions to ModernBattleScene
  - Enhanced encounter data management

#### 2. **🎮 MainMenuScene** - Game Entry Point
- **File**: `src/typescript/scenes/MainMenuScene.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Game initialization and bridge setup
  - Player statistics display (level, health, experience)
  - Current equipment display (weapon, armor)
  - Medical inventory summary with color coding
  - Interactive start button with hover effects
  - Keyboard input (Space/Enter to start)
  - Background image with fallback graphics
  - Game state management (reset/load functionality)
  - Health color coding (green/yellow/red based on percentage)

#### 3. **🏆 VictoryScene** - Post-Battle Rewards
- **File**: `src/typescript/scenes/VictoryScene.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Experience gain processing with level-up system
  - Automatic loot distribution from defeated enemies
  - Armor upgrade system (best available)
  - Medical item drops (25% chance per enemy)
  - Visual loot display with quantity indicators
  - Victory music and background
  - Player progression tracking
  - Return to world map functionality

#### 4. **💀 DeadScene** - Game Over Management
- **File**: `src/typescript/scenes/DeadScene.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Final statistics display (level, experience, equipment)
  - Game over processing and state reset
  - Death music and atmospheric visuals
  - Automatic progress reset to Level 1
  - Return to main menu functionality
  - Game state cleanup and persistence
  - Death cause tracking (extensible)

#### 5. **⚔️ BattleScene** - Combat System (Previously Completed)
- **File**: `src/typescript/scenes/BattleScene.ts`
- **Features**: Real-time combat, weapon management, enemy AI, etc.

### 🔧 **Service Layer Enhancements**

#### GameStateService Extensions:
```typescript
// Added encounter data management
setEncounterData(data: { enemyType: string; playerLevel: number }): void
getEncounterData(): { enemyType: string; playerLevel: number } | null
clearEncounterData(): void
```

#### LegacyBridge Integration:
- All scenes use LegacyBridge for service access
- Consistent initialization patterns
- Type-safe service coordination
- Seamless legacy compatibility

### 📊 **Technical Achievements**

#### **Modern Architecture**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Game logic in services, UI in scenes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with interfaces
- **Service Injection**: Dependency injection via LegacyBridge
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing assets
- **State Management**: Centralized via GameStateService

#### **Code Quality**:
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed design
- **Clean Code**: Clear naming, documented methods
- **Error Resilience**: Asset loading fallbacks
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uniform scene structure across all scenes

#### **Backward Compatibility**:
- All original gameplay mechanics preserved
- Asset paths and naming maintained
- Save/load system compatibility
- Seamless integration with existing systems

### 🧪 **Test Status**
- **✅ 59/59 core tests passing**
- **✅ TypeScript compilation clean**
- **✅ Service integration verified**
- **✅ Battle system compatibility maintained**
